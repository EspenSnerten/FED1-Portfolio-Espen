This is my portfolio project repo, this portfolio site is just a prototype and will not serve as my actual portfolio, this is just created for the assignment.

## Description

This one will be pretty short, this is a simple portfolio site that I created using html and CSS, everything is contained one one page and all relevant links are on this page.

The design is moderately straight forward, a simple background image of what appears to be visual studio code with some CSS written that is then dimmed with a background colour on the sections, the view going from desktop to mobile doesn't change all that much, except for the social media link box that is sticky'd to the page on desktop view, and falls down to a footer on mobile view.

The coding process was easy, nothing big here, I do have a functioning contact form, but to be honest the mail link in the social media box serves that purpose just as well as the form.

The cards with the site info looks okay, nothing spectacular and will be completely redone once the exam is graded and I revisit the the exam page and adjust a couple of things, the other two sites that there are links two will not be included in my future portfolio, they are just here for the assignment.

To conclude, this webpage was only designed and created to hit the assignment marks, I will be looking to create a much cooler portfolio during the summer.
